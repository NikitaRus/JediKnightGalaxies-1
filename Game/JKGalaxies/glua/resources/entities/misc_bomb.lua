	Jedi Knight Galaxies Entity

	Misc_bomb
	
	This is a test entity, to see if everything works
	This bomb is rigged with a 10 second fuse, which you can trigger by pressing use on it
	If the bomb takes damage, it'll ignite and explode (quite quickly :P)
	
	The entity is heavilly commented to make it easier for others to understand how this system works
	
	FUN! :P

-- Entity definition scripts such as this are not loaded as normal scripts.
-- They are loaded by a special entity loader which takes care of the spawning and controlling of scripted entities.
-- To define a scripted entity, all properties, events and variables of the entity must be placed inside the 'ENT' table/namespace.
-- This table is created by the loader prior to running this script, and is destroyed after processing it!
-- Therefore, functions maust never reference ENT directly! Instead, events can use 'self' to access their own entity object.
-- Everything defined in 'ENT' is available through 'self' inside the events.

-- Classname to be used for this entity (Mandatory, without this defined, the entity is discarded by the loader)
ENT.ClassName = "misc_bomb"
-- Type of this entity (generic, logical, mover and trigger are currently supported, also mandatory for the loader to accept this entity)
ENT.Type = "generic"
-- Scripted entity to derrive this one from.
-- Note that this must be another scripted entity. You cannot provide a fx_runner as base entity for example.
-- The entity manager/loader automatically creates standard base entities for every type, called base_<type>, so for this one, we'll use "base_generic"
ENT.Base = "base_generic"

-- In every event, the entity in question is passed as a special argument, called 'self'
-- ( table:function(a,b,c) is syntactic sugar for table.function(self, a, b, c), so in this case ENT:OnSpawn() is identical to ENT.OnSpawn(self) )

-- OnSpawn event, called when the entity just spawned
-- In here we have to do the initialization of the entity, processing of the spawnvars, and doing all the setup required to get the ent workin the way we want to
function ENT:OnSpawn()
	-- Set-up position, rotation (based on spawnvars) and model
	-- The 'or' is to specify a default value. A call to GetSpawnVar with an undefined var will return nil, in which case the alternative value is used
	-- So for example: If the spawnvar 'angles' is not defined, it'll use '0 0 0' instead
	self:SetPos( Vector(self:GetSpawnVar("origin") or "0 0 0") )
	self:SetAngles( Vector(self:GetSpawnVar("angles") or "0 0 0") )
	self:SetModel("models/map_objects/factory/bomb_new.md3")
	-- Automatically create a bounding box to fit the model + rotation
	self:AutoBox()
	-- Creating custom variables in entities is very simple, just use entity.<variable name>.
	-- So creating a custom variable called lol containing "my value", can be done with entity.lol = "my value"
	-- Any valid variable name is allowed as long as the name doesn't match one of the built-in functions of entities (so entity.SetPos = "my value" won't work as expected)
	
	-- Get the 'fuse' spawnvar (or 10 if not defined) to use as fuse time
	self.FuseLength = tonumber(self:GetSpawnVar("fuse") or "10")
	-- Set timeout for the use to 0, so we can use it right now
	self.UseTimeout = 0
	-- Make the entity solid
	self:SetContents(CONTENTS_SOLID)

-- OnDie event, called when the entity gets hit and the HP dropped below 0 (Assuming the entity can take damage to begin with)
-- Inflictor and attacker both signify the entities responsible for the kill
-- Usually the inflictor and attacker are one and the same entity (or inflictor is not defined and only an attacker is provided)
-- An example where they differ, is when a player shoots a rocket, where the rocket is the inflictor, and the player who shot it the attacker

-- After using that method, the server will call OnThink after the delay (in ms) passed
