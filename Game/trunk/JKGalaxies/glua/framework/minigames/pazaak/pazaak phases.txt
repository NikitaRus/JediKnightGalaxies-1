Pazaak Turn phases

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 0: Initialisation

* Create side-decks
* Initiate pazaak boards on clients
* Transmit player names and hand cards to clients
* Randomly select first player to play
* Shuffle main deck

-> Go to phase 1

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 1: Turn start

* Check if we gotta start a new set (from phase 4), and do it if so
* - Shuffle main deck
* - Clear board slots
* - Reset points

* Change turn (or set to initial turn if coming from phase 0)
* Update turn indicator on client side

-> Go to phase 2 with a delay

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2: Draw Card

* Draw card from top of main deck
* Put card on board and update points for both players
* If point total is 20, stand and jump to phase 4

-> Go to phase 3 (or 4 is the point total if 20) with a delay

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 3: Hand card & stand

* If it's a player's turn:
* - Set timeout at 15 seconds (if the opponent is not AI)
* - Allow player to use cards and stand/end turn buttons
* - Wait for player to provide feedback (feedback will be 'end turn' if the timeout expires)
* - If card is chosen:
* - - Add card to the field, apply any effects
* - - Calculate new total
* - - If total is 20, stand
* - - If card was a tiebreaker, enable tiebreaker flag
* - If chosen to stand, stand.
* - Disable use of cards and stand/end turn button
* If it's the AI's turn:
* - Run AI code and obtain card to use and whether to stand
* - Process the feedback just like it would on a player

-> Go to phase 4 with a delay

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 4: Turn end

* Check if the point total is over 20, if so..
* - Update score
* - Check if someone just won 3 sets, if so, goto phase 5 without delay
* - Show the win/loss set dialogs to both players
* - Set 'start new set' flag
* If both players are standing..
* - Compare score, handle win/loss/tie scenarios (take tie-breaker into account)
* - Update score
* - Check if someone just won 3 sets, if so, goto phase 5 without delay
* - Show win/loss/tie dialogs
* - Set 'start new set' flag
* If a dialog was shown:
* - Set timeout of 8 seconds
* - When both players close the dialog, continue (AI instantly closes it)
* - If, after 8 seconds, a player still has it open, force it to close and proceed
* Clear tie-breaker flag

-> Goto phase 1 with a delay

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 5: Clear up

* Display you won/lost
* Set timeout of 8 seconds (only if the opponent is not AI)
* - If both players close the dialog within the set time, continue (AI closes instantly)
* - After 8 seconds, force the dialogs to close if not closed yet
* Close the pazaak boards
* Call callback function presenting the winner
* Stop further execution

------------------------------------------------------------
Phase x: Special situations

* At every phase, the presence of both players are evaluated, if one is not there anymore:
* - Check if the other isnt there either, if so:
* - - Abort the pazaak game at once.
* - If the other player is there:
* - - Declare the other player the winner and go to phase 5 immediately, without timeout
* If a player forfeits:
* - Abort the game at once, declare the opponent the winner, proceed to phase 5 immediately
